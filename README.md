# friend

In this project I attempted to create a friend finder type of app that would match someone up based on a series of questions. 
I was able to get the back end to record onto my terminal the name of the person submitting the survey. I however was unable to complete the part concerning showing a person as a match for the new best friend.
I also encountered an error related to the .length saying that it was undefined.
